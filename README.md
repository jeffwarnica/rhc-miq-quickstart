# JW-Quickstart
This is my collection of automate code and dialogs to quickly get up
a useful CloudForms setup. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

# Requirements
This has been "tested" against CloudForms 4.6.

This requires at least the Automate part of
https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/miq-Utilities

# Design goals
To make my life easier.

To not directly require the now old (4.2) versions of CF_E which I consider
useful. This implies I'm allowing myself to straight copy some of those files.
This includes drop down helpers, and will expand as I need them.


# Inspiration & Sources

The aforementioned miq-Utilities.
