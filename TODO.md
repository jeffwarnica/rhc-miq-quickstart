# Flavors
* Have an embeddable method that includes a hash of the flavor name, sizes, details
  per the classic CF_E style.
* Have a drop down builder, which simply builds a dropdown from the included structure.
  (and update the sample dialogs)
* Include that structure in b_v_p.rb and do the right thing, updating infrastructure
  providers, matching to cloud flavors.
